Due: 20. Feb (70 Points)

Overview
--------

Unlike previous homework assignments, this homework will require you to write
proofs and argue your point.  Thus, it's important that your write clearly and
rigorously argue your point.

You are welcome to discuss the problems with others in the class.  However:

* All solutions must be written individually and by yourself.  You cannot write
up your solution in a group.
* You cannot share completed solutions with others.
* Do not look for completed solutions on the Internet.

If you are not able to complete these sorts of problems on your own, you will be
at a huge disadvantage when it comes time to solve similar problems on the
midterm.

What you can assume
------

You can assume any inequality in the books appendicies or anything we *proved*
in class.  If you have doubts, ask on Piazza.

What to turn in
------

Turn in a PDF with your completed assignment.  You may want to pay attention to
